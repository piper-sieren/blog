## Calling APIs with a Node.js backend

#### What is Node.js?
Node.js is a single-thread, asynchronous, event-driven JavaScript runtime solution, but what does that mean? To put it in high level terms, Node.js can be used to facilitate calls between the front and back end of your web application in a memory effient, easy to learn format. Lets say you have a web application written in a JavaScript framework, such as React. Your web application will be fairly pointless without any kind of data interaction, so lets also say you have an API that you're needing to connect to. With this API, you'll be needing to make GET, POST, and PUT calls at the very leasts. The entire purpose of your web application is to create a solution for interacting with this API in a user friendly way.
